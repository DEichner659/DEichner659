- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DEichner659
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in VU+ / VTI Solo2 extensions as well as nice upgrades for my Synology DiskStation and Raspberry Pi.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to bring the stuff from this plattform onto my devices ;-)
- I am also experimenting with artificial intelligence for different use cases, especially MCP and local AI on MacBookPro M4 Pro
